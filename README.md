# ðŸŽ¬ AI Movie Recommendation System (MVP)

This project builds an **AI-powered movie recommender** using OpenAI embeddings, k-Nearest Neighbors, and Streamlit.  
The goal is to demonstrate how natural language can drive movie discovery â€” users can type a description or title, and the model retrieves similar films based on semantic similarity.

---

## ðŸ§± Project Summary

This app is designed to:
- Use **OpenAI embeddings** to numerically represent movie descriptions.
- Store and search those embeddings efficiently using **vector similarity**.
- Serve recommendations through an interactive **Streamlit UI**.
- Be modular enough for future extensions (e.g., RAG pipelines, user-based personalization).

## ðŸ§© Milestones & Summary (Completed so far)

| Stage | What We Did | Why It Mattered |
|-------|--------------|----------------|
| **M1 â€“ Environment Setup** | Created virtual environment, folder structure (`src/`, `data/`, `artifacts/`), and installed dependencies | Establishes a clean, modular workspace for reproducibility |
| **M2 â€“ Dependencies & Data** | Installed `openai`, `pandas`, `numpy`, `scikit-learn`, and `streamlit`; loaded and cleaned movie dataset | Ensures the environment can support embeddings, vector search, and a web app |
| **M3 â€“ Data Assembly** | Built `movie_texts.json` combining movie title, year, and genre | Provides natural language descriptions for the embedding model |
| **M4 â€“ Embedding Index** | Generated embeddings via OpenAI API, handled API quota/rate errors, stored in `artifacts/movie_vectors.npy` | Converts each movie into a numerical vector for similarity search |
| **Repo Hygiene & Git Setup** | Configured `.env`, `.gitignore`, removed large files, and pushed a clean repo to GitHub | Prevents leaking secrets, large files, or intermediate artifacts |

## ðŸ§­ Next Steps

| Upcoming Stage | Goal |
|----------------|------|
| **M5 â€“ Retrieval System (kNN)** | Load vectors and metadata to compute top-5 similar movies per query |
| **M6 â€“ Streamlit UI** | Connect retrieval logic to an app interface |
| **M7 â€“ LLM Integration** | Add natural-language explanations for recommendations |
| **M8 â€“ Deployment** | Host app on Streamlit Cloud or GitHub Pages with a public demo link |

Tech Stack
Core: Python, Streamlit, OpenAI API, scikit-learn
Data Handling: Pandas, NumPy
Infrastructure: Git, Conda
Future Additions: Pinecone / FAISS (vector DB), LangChain integration




## ðŸ§  Learning Goals
- Practice building a multimodal recommendation workflow.
- Use embeddings + KNN for semantic search.
- Integrate OpenAI models into a small full-stack prototype.

This project isnâ€™t just about building a recommender â€” itâ€™s about understanding how semantic similarity, vector representations, and retrieval pipelines can evolve into full-scale AI products.
Every milestone mirrors the real-world process of building AI-driven apps: from prototype to deployment with transparency, modularity, and best practices.
